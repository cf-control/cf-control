# cf-control [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/cf-control/cf-control/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/cf-control/cf-control?branch=master)

Declarative command line tool for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.


## Prerequisites

* Java JRE (Version 8 or newer).
* Gradle


## Environment Setup

Follow the instructions below to setup your environment so that
you can run the __cf-control__ application.

* Download the source code from GitHub.

  ``` git clone https://github.com/cf-control/cf-control.git```

* Change the directory and build the project.

  ```cd cf-control/cloud.foundry.cli && ./gradlew build```

  This command will generate a JAR output __cf-control.jar__
  in the **_cf-control/cloud.foundry.cli/build/libs_** folder.

* Define environment variables (Optional).

    To reduce the amount of parameters on the command line, you can define environment variables for your credentials.

  * ```CF_CONTROL_USER``` describes your account's e-mail address or username.
  * ```CF_CONTROL_PASSWORD``` describes the password of your cf account.


## How to execute a command?

Change the current directory to the JAR output folder `cf-control/cloud.foundry.cli/build/libs`.

Then you can run the `cf-control.jar` by using the command line tool like:

```
java -jar cf-control.jar [COMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND] [PARAMS]
```


## Logging

The application logs its activities using multiple loglevels. At the moment, the default level is `INFO`. Verbosity can be increased to *verbose* or even *debug* logging by setting the `VERBOSE` respectively `DEBUG` environment variables to any value, or by using the `--debug/-d` and `-v/--verbose` CLI options.

The loglevel is always configured to the most verbose value the user specified. For instance, if both *verbose* and *debug* logging are enabled, the application will use the *debug* level.

The application also supports a quiet mode, which can be enabled by setting the environment variable `QUIET` to any value or via the `-q/--quiet` CLI option.

### Convenience features

You are able to include contents of other YAML files into the one that you pass as an argument to the tool. To do so, you have to use the so called **$ref-syntax**. A description on how to use it can be found [here](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/using-ref/).
* The tool supports **Remote References** and **URL References**.
* **Local References** are not natively supported, but you can achieve the same effect by using **Anchors and Alisases** as they are stated in the YAML specification.


### Demo Files

In this [folder](cloud.foundry.cli/src/test/resources/demo/) we provide example YAML files that may help in
understanding how to use our tool. What can I use the files for?

* [appJava.yml](cloud.foundry.cli/src/test/resources/demo/appJava.yml): Reference for create/update/remove of an 
application.
* [appPython.yml](cloud.foundry.cli/src/test/resources/demo/appPython.yml): Reference for create/update/remove of an
application.
* [getAll.yml](cloud.foundry.cli/src/test/resources/demo/appJava.yml): Example output of the **get all** command. 
In this exmaple you can see how you have to structure the yml Files in general.
* [refDemo.yml](cloud.foundry.cli/src/test/resources/demo/refDemo.yml) & 
:[referred.yml](cloud.foundry.cli/src/test/resources/demo/referred.yml) Example how you can use the ref syntax in the 
context of creating services (command: create services)
* [services.yml](cloud.foundry.cli/src/test/resources/demo/services.yml): Reference for create/remove of 
services.
* [spaceDeveloper.yml](cloud.foundry.cli/src/test/resources/demo/spaceDeveloper.yml):  Reference for create/remove of 
space developers.

__Happy coding!__
